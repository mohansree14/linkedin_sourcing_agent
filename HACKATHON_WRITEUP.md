# LinkedIn Sourcing Agent - Technical Write-up

## Approach

Our LinkedIn Sourcing Agent transforms traditional recruitment through an intelligent, multi-layered automation system. The architecture follows enterprise patterns with distinct separation of concerns: **core agent orchestration**, **multi-source data collection**, **AI-powered scoring**, and **personalized outreach generation**.

The system starts with intelligent candidate discovery using LinkedIn's professional network, enhanced by GitHub profiles for technical validation and Stack Overflow for community engagement metrics. Each candidate undergoes comprehensive scoring against customizable rubrics, weighing technical skills (40%), relevant experience (30%), education (20%), and location fit (10%).

**Key Innovation**: Our dual-mode operation supports both production APIs and demo data, ensuring hackathon judges can test functionality without API keys. The scoring system combines rule-based expertise matching with AI-driven contextual analysis, producing confidence-weighted scores from 0-100.

The outreach generation leverages GPT-4 for personalized messaging when APIs are available, with intelligent template fallbacks maintaining quality at scale. Export functionality provides clean, professional Excel workbooks and real-time Google Sheets integration for collaborative recruitment workflows.

## Challenges Faced

**1. Data Quality & Consistency**: LinkedIn profile data varies significantly in structure and completeness. We solved this with robust parsing logic that handles multiple headline formats, extracting clean company names while filtering technical expertise descriptions (e.g., "Netflix â€¢ Kubernetes Expert" becomes "Netflix").

**2. Rate Limiting & API Management**: Professional APIs impose strict quotas. Our solution implements intelligent rate limiting (20 requests/minute), smart caching with TTL management, and graceful degradation to demo data when limits are exceeded.

**3. Scoring Complexity**: Balancing objective criteria with subjective fit required extensive calibration. We developed a weighted scoring system with configurable rubrics, confidence indicators, and detailed breakdown explanations for transparency.

**4. Export Format Standardization**: Recruiters need consistent, professional outputs. We engineered multi-sheet Excel exports with formatted data, proper LinkedIn URL inclusion, and Google Sheets real-time collaboration features.

**5. Production Readiness**: Moving from prototype to enterprise-grade required comprehensive logging, error handling, configuration management, and scalable architecture patterns.

## Scaling to 100s of Jobs

**Architectural Scaling**:
- **Microservices Decomposition**: Split into dedicated services for scraping, scoring, and outreach, enabling independent scaling and technology choices
- **Message Queue Integration**: Implement Redis/RabbitMQ for asynchronous job processing, handling burst traffic and long-running searches
- **Database Optimization**: Transition from file-based storage to PostgreSQL with proper indexing for candidate deduplication and historical tracking

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Intelligent Caching**: Multi-tier caching (Redis for hot data, PostgreSQL for persistent storage) with smart invalidation strategies
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple candidates simultaneously with configurable concurrency limits respecting API quotas
- **CDN Integration**: Cache static assets and frequent responses for sub-second API response times

**Operational Excellence**:
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Implement Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and distributed tracing for real-time system health
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes deployment with horizontal pod autoscaling based on queue depth and CPU utilization
- **Multi-region Deployment**: Geographic distribution for global recruitment with data locality compliance

**Advanced Features**:
- **ML Pipeline Integration**: Real-time model retraining based on recruiter feedback and hiring outcomes
- **Smart Job Matching**: Automatic candidate-to-job matching using vector similarity and collaborative filtering
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast candidate response rates and optimize outreach timing

The system's modular design ensures each component scales independently, supporting enterprise recruitment teams processing thousands of candidates across hundreds of simultaneous job searches while maintaining sub-second response times and 99.9% availability.

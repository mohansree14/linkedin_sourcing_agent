# ðŸ”§ DEPLOYMENT FIX APPLIED

## âœ… Issues Resolved

The deployment errors have been fixed:

1. **packages.txt** - Removed comments that were causing package manager errors
2. **requirements.txt** - Cleaned and simplified for Streamlit Cloud compatibility

## ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy Again

Your LinkedIn Sourcing Agent is now properly configured for Streamlit Cloud.

### Push the Fix:
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Then Deploy:
1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud app
2. Click "Reboot app" or redeploy
3. Or create a new deployment with the fixed files

## âœ… Fixed Files:
- `packages.txt` - Now empty (no system packages needed)
- `requirements.txt` - Clean, minimal dependencies
- `streamlit_app.py` - Your original app (unchanged)

## ðŸŽ¯ Your App Will Now Deploy Successfully!

The deployment should complete without errors in 2-3 minutes.

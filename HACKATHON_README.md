steady_growth = analyze_progression(experience)
if steady_growth: score = 6-8

# Company Relevance (15%)
big_tech = ['Google', 'Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Meta', 'Amazon']
if current_company in big_tech: score = 9-10

# Experience Match (25%) - Highest weight
skill_overlap = calculate_overlap(candidate_skills, job_requirements)
if perfect_match: score = 9-10

# Location Match (10%)
if exact_city_match: score = 10
if same_metro: score = 8

# Tenure (10%)
